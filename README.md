# SOLID Principles Examples

This repository contains simple code examples demonstrating the **SOLID Principles** of Object-Oriented Design in software development.

## What is SOLID?

**SOLID** is an acronym representing five key design principles aimed at creating maintainable, flexible, and scalable software systems:

1. **S — Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
   A class should have only one reason to change.

2. **O — Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**  
   Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

3. **L — Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**  
   Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering program correctness.

4. **I — Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**  
   Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

5. **D — Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**  
   High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
